# TreeSizeClone

TreeSizeClone is a program to monitor and analyze how your computer's memory is managed. It allows you to explore the size of directories and files in a given path.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Build the project using your preferred development environment.
3. Run the compiled program.

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter the path you want to analyze.
2. The program will display the size of the target directory and its subdirectories.
3. Files within each directory will be listed, along with their respective sizes.
4. Directories will be displayed with a hierarchical structure, using indentation.

## Features

- Recursive analysis: The program analyzes the size of subdirectories within the target directory.
- Sorting: Files and subdirectories are sorted by their absolute sizes, in descending order.
- File size conversion: File sizes are converted to a more readable format, such as kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), and gigabytes (GB).

## Requirements

- .NET Framework or .NET Core runtime

## Limitations

- Access restrictions: If the program encounters non-accessible directories, it will display an error message and skip those directories.
